**Assignment**: SWE363 - Assignment 1

## 1. Tools Used & Use Cases
- **GitHub Copilot**: Used for generating CSS boilerplate and the initial Flexbox structure of the fixed sidebar layout. It also assisted in creating the responsive navigation structure.
- **Claude / ChatGPT**: Utilized for debugging the `IntersectionObserver` JavaScript logic and explaining complex concepts like semantic HTML and responsive design. They also helped structure the comprehensive technical documentation.

## 2. Benefits & Challenges
- **Benefits**: The AI significantly reduced development time for boilerplate code and suggested professional color schemes (Deep Purple and Peach) that match a professional aesthetic.
- **Challenges**: Initial AI-generated code sometimes used non-semantic HTML comments or generic solutions that required manual modification to fit specific project goals, such as mobile responsiveness.

## 3. Learning Outcomes
I learned how to implement the **Intersection Observer API** for scroll-triggered animations, which is more performant than traditional scroll events. I also improved my understanding of **responsive design** by refining media queries to handle various mobile viewports correctly.

## 4. Responsible Use & Modifications

Every AI-generated snippet was reviewed and manually adjusted. I customized all project descriptions and experience details to reflect my actual work as student in KFUPM, such as the **Fast3R model** research and winning the **KFUPM Rally**. I also converted JS-style comments in HTML to proper semantic HTML comments to ensure code quality.
